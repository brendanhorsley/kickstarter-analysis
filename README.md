# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
Kickstarter is a platform in which individuals seek crowdfounding for campaigns they launch. 
Louise launched a campaign for her theater play Fever and was able to successfully reach her campaign goal.
She now wants to investigate how other campaigns failed or succeeded.

### Purpose
The purpose of this study is to investigate the outcomes of theater campaigns launched on Kickstarter.
Specifically this analysis will focus on success of campaigns based on their fundraising goals and their launch dates.

## Analysis and Challenges
The data on kickstarter campaigns is quite large and includes many campaigns that Louise has no interest in.
The analysis was able to filter the data to only theater campaigns which is more relevant to the information Louise is looking for.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The line chart below visualizes data on the outcomes of theater campaigns based on the month of their launch date.

We can see the number of successful campaigns consistently stays above the failures, peaking at its highest level in May and sinking to the lowest in December.
The number of failed campaigns remains quite consistent throughout all months around 40
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The data below is examing the success rates of theater play campaigns launched on Kickstarter based on the campaign goals.

The success rate, failure rate, and cancel rate are all included in the graph. 
No campaigns were cancelled in the data set. 
Campaigns with goals under $15,000 seem to have the most success.
Campaigns with goals above $45,000 appear to have the largest failure percentage.

## Results

Analysis of data based on launch date showed that campaigns launched around May or June had a lot of success.
The data showed that the number of failuers did not increase to a similar degree at this time period.
Therefore, the reason for the spike of success was not simply due to an increased volume during this time period, but instead that campaigns succeeded at a higher rate.
Similarly, we can see that success has a sharp decrease for campaigns launched in November and December despite a relatively stable number of failures.
Therefore, the data suggests May and June are better times to launch a theater campaign than November through January. 

The analysis of outcomes based on goals showed that campaigns with goals under $15000 were more likely to succeed than fail.
Campaigns with goals over $45,000 were more likely to fail. 
Campaigns with goals between $35,000 and $45,500 had good success rates, however the sample sizes were much smaller for these campaigns so it may be hard to make a conclusion based on this number. 

The data for campaigns with goals above $25,000 is much smaller than for campaigns with goals lesser than $25,000 giving the analysis some limitations.
